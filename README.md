Project Title: Spotify Songs Analysis

In this project, I have used the 19,000 Spotify Songs dataset available on Kaggle. The aim of this project work is to perform all the neccessary steps(ETL, EDA, Feature Engineering, Model Training, Evaluation, etc) in order to understand the dataset and also perform necessary processing in order to prepare the dataset for training on ML models so that one can predict popularity of various songs present in the dataset.
